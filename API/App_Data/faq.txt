How do I place an order?
Simply browse our product categories, add items to your cart, and proceed to checkout. Youâ€™ll need to provide delivery details and payment information to complete your order.

Do I need a prescription to order?
Just a friendly reminder that all prescription medications need a valid prescription. Feel free to reach out to your GP and ask them to send the prescription over to us. OTC (over-the-counter) products do not require one.

What delivery options are available?
We offer same-day, next-day, and standard delivery depending on your location. Delivery options will be shown at checkout.
          
Can I return my order?
Unused, sealed products can be returned within 7 days of delivery. Prescription drugs and opened items are not eligible for return due to health regulations.

How can I contact customer support?
You can reach us 24/7 via email at support@medimart.com or call 0800-123-4567.
